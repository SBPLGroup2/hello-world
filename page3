	<h1>Guy Fawkes Day</h1> 
		<p>Bonfire Night, a different kind of fall festival.</p>
		<h2>Remember, remember the fifth of November</h2>
		<img src="guy_fawkes.jpg" height="200" width="200" alt="Halloween image" align="left" hspace="10"/>
		<p>In Great Britain, where Protestantism eliminated celebrations based around All Saints Day, a different kind of fall festival emerged in the form of Guy Fawkes Day. While it shares some similar traditions to Halloween, such as bonfires and parades where children chant "penny for the guy" in an effort to collect money for their creatively rendered effigies - an act that resembles trick-or-treating, Guy Fawkes Day commemorates an historical event.</p>
		<p>Guy Fawkes and 12 other Catholic conspirators plotted to use gunpowder to blow up King James I at the opening of Parliament on November 5th, 1605. They would then kidnap princess Elizabeth, install her as a puppet Queen, marry her to a Catholic, and restore the Catholic monarchy. Their plot was discovered before it could commence and Fawkes was found guilty of high treason, hung, drawn, and quartered.</p>
		<p>The anniversary is celebrated, mostly in England, by lighting bonfires, burning effigies, and setting off fireworks. It is primarily a social holiday, but has political undertones, as current politicians and celebrities can often be found burning in effigy alongside Guy Fawkes. The image of Guy Fawkes has taken on a meaning independent of the holiday. The face of Guy Fawkes - his mask - has come to be known as dissent, and is used thusly in various social venues. <em>The guy lives.</em> </p>
